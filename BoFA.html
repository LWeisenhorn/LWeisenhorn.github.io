        <h1>Architecture Tracking System</h1>
        <h2>Internship Project</h2>
        <p>This is a project that I worked on during my Bank of America internship in Summer 2022. I codeveloped this system alongside senior technology employees. The system was based in Excel and utilized VB Scripting to automate aspects of it. Now this project is used everyday by the Global finance and treasury team to track their ongoing projects and progress. Additionally this allowed for the team to see areas needing attention within the team.</p>

        <p>Due to the nature of my contract signed with Bank of America I am unable to divulge any specific screenshots of the finished result or discuss specifics of the software itself without permission. However, if you are interested, I can send you references at Bank of America where you can discuss the project further.</p>
