        <h1 id="title" class="subheader">Logic Gate Simulator</h1>
        <p>I developed this web app to assist in the learning and understanding of boolean logic gates. I sought to create
            this after I watched many of my class mates fail to grasp the concepts in class. After talking to some of them
            I gathered that a simulator tool for boolean logic gates would drastically increase their confidence in the 
            material. Thus I created this web app to be readily accessible for any student in need.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheader">The Development</h2>
        <p>I wrote all of the logic for the application as well as the graphics in JavaScript. In addition to the JavaScript,
            I used CSS and HTML to style and structure the webpage. I intentionally left the application minimal and lightweight so that
            the website would be able to be accessed by the widest ranges of devices.
        </p>

        <p>Above you can see my design for the website. The user is able to select a logic gate of their choice as well as their two inputs.
            Based on the user input, the graphic is drawn as well as logic expressions and a truth table for the gate and the current row being
            highlighted. The graphic and expressions automatically updates when any of the information is changed.
