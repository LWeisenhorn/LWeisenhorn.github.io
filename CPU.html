    <h1>8 Bit CPU</h1>
    <p>This is a semester long project I worked on during my ITSC 3181 course, Introduction to Computer Architecture.
        This course had a focus on understanding how low level programming languages like assembly and specifically
        RISC-V worked. A large segment of this class was designing a CPU to perform basic operations and thoeretically
        take code inputs to properly function.
    </p>
    <h2>The Design</h2>
    <p>I built the CPU using an virtual circuit builder and started from scratch building each component.
        To make the circuits more readable, I saved each smaller segment like the ALU, Arithmatic Logic Unit, as it's own circuit
        and imported it back into the main circuit. Each imported circuit is represented by a large yellow square on the diagram with a label. Due to website
        storage concerns, I will not be able to show each individual circuit.

    <p>Above you can see my design I made for my CPU. I modeled it off of a simple CPU that is pictured below.</p>
